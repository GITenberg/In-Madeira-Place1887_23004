    <h1>
      IN MADEIRA PLACE.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      By Heman White Chaplin
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning from the street which follows the line of the wharves, into
      Madeira Place, you leave at once an open region of docks and spars for
      comparative retirement. Wagons seldom enter Madeira Place: it is too hard
      to turn them in it; and then the inhabitants, for the most part, have a
      convenient way of buying their coal by the basket. How much trouble it
      would save, if we would all buy our coal by the basket!
    </p>
    <p>
      A few doors up the place a passageway makes off to the right, through a
      high wooden gate that is usually open; and at the upper corner of this
      passage stands a brick house, whose perpetually closed blinds suggest the
      owner's absence. But the householders of Madeira Place do not absent
      themselves, even in summer; they could hardly get much nearer to the sea.
      And if you will take the pains to seat yourself, toward the close of day,
      upon an opposite doorstep, between two rows of clamorous little girls
      sliding, with screams of painful joy, down the rough hammered stone, to
      the improvement of their clothing, you will see that the house is by-no
      means untenanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every evening it is much the same thing. First, following close upon the
      heels of sunset, comes a grizzly, tall, and slouching man, in the cap and
      blouse of a Union soldier, bearing down with his left hand upon a cane,
      and dragging his left foot heavily behind him, while with his right hand
      he holds by a string a cluster of soaring toy balloons, and also drags, by
      its long wooden tongue, a rude child's cart, in which is a small
      hand-organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next will come, most likely, a dark, bent, keen-eyed old woman, with her
      parchment face shrunk into deep wrinkles. She bears a dangling placard,
      stating, in letters of white upon a patent-leather background, what you
      might not otherwise suspect,&mdash;that she was a soldier under the great
      Napoleon, and fought with him at Waterloo. She also bears, since music
      goes with war, a worn accordion. She is the old woman to whose shrivelled,
      expectant countenance you sometimes offer up a copper coin, as she kneels
      by the flagged crossway path of the Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is succeeded, perhaps, by a couple of black-haired, short,
      broad-shouldered men, leading a waddling, unconcerned bear, and talking
      earnestly together in a language which you will hardly follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then you will see six or eight or ten other sons and daughters of toil,
      most of them with balloons.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these people will turn, between the high, ball-topped gate-posts, into
      the alley, and descend at once to the left, by a flight of three or four
      steps, to a side basement door.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they begin to flock in, you will see through the alley gate a dark,
      thick-set man, of middle age, but with very little hair, come and stand at
      the foot of the steps, in the doorway. It is Sorel, the master of the
      house; for this is the <i>Maison Sorel</i>. Some of his guests he greets
      with a Noachian deluge of swift French words and high-pitched cries of
      welcome. It is thus that he receives those capitalists, the bear-leaders
      from the Pyrenees; it is thus that he greets the grizzled man in the blue
      cap and blouse,&mdash;Fidèle the old soldier, Fidèle the pensioner, to
      whom a great government, far away, at Washington, doubtless with much else
      on its mind, never forgets to send by mail, each quarter-day morning, a
      special, personal communication, marked with Fidèle's own name, enclosing
      the preliminaries of a remittance: "Accept" (as it were) "this slight
      tribute." "<i>Ah! que c'est un gouvernement! Voilà une république!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Even a Frenchman may be proud to be an American!
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of his guests, however, Sorel receives with a mere pantomime of
      wide-opened eyes and extended hands and shrugged-up shoulders, accompanied
      by a long-drawn "<i>Eh!</i>" by which he bodies forth a thousand
      refinements of thought which language would fail to express. Does a fresh
      immigrant from the Cévennes bring back at night but one or two of the gay
      balloons with which she was stocked in the morning, or, better, none; or,
      on the other hand, does a stalwart man just from the rich Brie country
      return at sundown in abject despair, bringing back almost all of the red
      and blue globes which floated like a radiant constellation of hope about
      his head when he set forth in the early morning, Sorel can express, by his
      "<i>Eh!</i>" and some slight movement, with subtle exactness and with no
      possibility of being misapprehended, the precise shade of feeling with
      which the result inspires him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there he stops. Nothing is said. Sorel is a philosopher: he has
      indicated volumes, and he will not dilute with language. One who has fired
      a little lead bullet does not need to throw after it a bushel of
      mustard-seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company, as they come in, one by one, wash their hands and faces, if
      they see fit, at the kitchen sink, and dry them on a long roller-towel,&mdash;a
      device adopted, probably, from the Americans. Then they retire to the room
      behind the kitchen, and seat themselves at a long table, at which the
      bear-leaders place themselves only after seeing their animal fed, in the
      coalhole, where he is quartered.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the supper-table all is joy, even with the hopeless. Fidèle beams with
      good-humor, and not infrequently is called on to describe, amid a general
      hush, for the benefit of some new-comer from "<i>la belle France</i>" the
      quarterly receipt of the communication from Washington: how he stays at
      home that day, and shaves, and waits at the door for "<i>la poste</i>;"
      how the gray-uniformed letter-carrier appears, hands out a letter "as
      large as that," and nods smilingly to Fidèle: he, too, fought at "<i>la
      Montagne du Lookout</i>." The amount of the sergeant's pension astonishes
      them, wonted as they are to the pecuniary treatment of soldiers in the Old
      World. "<i>Mais</i>, it is a fortune! Fidèle is a <i>vrai rentier!</i> Ah!
      <i>une république comme ça!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, however, Fidèle contents himself at the evening meal with
      smiling good-humoredly on everybody and rapidly passing in, under his
      drooping mustache, spoonfuls of soup, morsels from the long French loaf,
      and draughts of lager beer; for only the rich can have wine in this
      country, and in the matter of drink an exile must needs lower his
      standard, as the prodigal lowered his.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Sorel and his wife and their busy maid fly in and out with <i>potage</i>
      and <i>rôti</i>, "<i>t-r-r-rès succulent</i>," the history of which we
      must not pry too deeply into, there is much excited conversation. You see
      at once that many amusing things happen to one who sells balloons all day
      upon the Park. And there are varied fortunes to recount. Such a lady
      actually wished to buy three for fifty cents! Such a "police-er-mann" is
      to be highly commended; such another looks with an evil eye upon all: he
      should truly be removed from office. There is a rumor that a license fee
      is to be required by the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this is food for discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper they all sit about the kitchen or in the alley-way, chatting,
      smoking. She who has been lucky in her sales basks in Sorel's favor. The
      unfortunate peasant from the Brie country feels the little bullet in his
      heart, and nurses a desperate resolution to redeem himself on the morrow:
      one must live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, if you happen to pass there on a warm evening, you may see a
      young woman, rather handsome, sitting sidewise on the outer basement
      steps, looking absently before her, straight-backed, upright, with her
      hands clasped about one knee, with her skirt sweeping away: a picture of
      Alsace. I have never been able to find out who she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening there is a little flutter among this brood. A gentleman, at
      the alley door, wishes to see M. Sorel. M. Sorel leads the gentleman out,
      through the alley gate, to the front street-door; then, retiring whence he
      came, he shortly appears from within at the front door, which opens only
      after a struggle. A knot of small boys has instantly gathered, apparently
      impressed with a vague, awful expectation that the gentleman about to
      enter will never come out. Realizing, however, that in that case there
      will be nothing to see, they slowly disperse when the door is closed, and
      resume their play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorel ushers the gentleman into the front parlor, which is Sorel's
      bedroom, which is also the storehouse of his merchandise, which is also
      the nursery. At this moment an infant is sleeping in a trundle-bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman takes a chair. So does Sorel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman does not talk French. Fortunately, M. Sorel can speak the
      English: he has learned it in making purchases for his table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am an officer of the government," says Mr. Fox, with a very sharp,
      distinct utterance, "in the custom-house. You know 'customhouse'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Sorel does not commit himself. He is an importer of toys. One must be
      on his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, a complicated explanation: this street, and that street, and
      the other street, and this building, and the market, and the great
      building standing here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! yes! M. Sorel identifies the building. Then he is informed that many
      government officers are there. He knew it very well before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation goes a step farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fox is one of those officers. The government is at present in need of
      a gentleman absolutely trustworthy, for certain important duties: perhaps
      to judge of silks; perhaps to oversee the weighing of sugar, of iron, of
      diamonds; perhaps to taste of wines. Who can say what service this great
      government may not need from its children!
    </p>
    <p>
      With some labor, since the English is only a translucent, and not a
      transparent medium to Sorel, this is made clear. Still the horizon is
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fox draws his chair nearer, facing Sorel, who looks uneasy: Sorel's
      feelings, to the thousandth degree of subdivision, are always declaring
      themselves in swift succession upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fox proceeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The great officer of the custom-house, the collector&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Le chef?</i>" interrupts Sorel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;yes, the <i>chef</i> (Mr. Fox seizes upon the word and clings to
      it),&mdash;the <i>chef</i> has been speaking anxiously to Mr. Fox about
      this vacancy: Mr. Fox is in the <i>chefs</i> confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" from Sorel, in a tone of utter bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must have," the <i>chef</i> had said to Mr. Fox,&mdash;"we must have
      for this place a noble man, a man with a large heart" (the exact required
      dimensions Mr. Fox does not give); "a man who loves his government, a man
      who has showed himself ready to die for her; we must have"&mdash;here Mr.
      Fox bends forward and lays his hand upon Sorel's knee, and looks him in
      the eye,&mdash;"we must have&mdash;<i>a soldier!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" says Sorel, moving his chair back a little, unconsciously, "<i>il
      faut un soldat!</i> I un-'stan',&mdash;<i>le chef</i> 'e boun' to 'ave one
      sol'ier!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still no comprehension of the stranger's object. Curiosity, however,
      prompts Sorel at this point to an inquiry: "'Ow much 'e goin' pay 'im?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fox suggests that he guess. M. Sorel guesses, boldly, and high,&mdash;almost
      insolently high,&mdash;eight dollars a week: she is so generous, <i>la
      République!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Higher!" Sorel's eyes open. He guesses again, and recklessly: "<i>Dix
      dollars par semaine</i>; you know&mdash;ten dol-lar ever-y week."
    </p>
    <p>
      Try again,&mdash;again,&mdash;again! He guesses,&mdash;madly now, as one
      risks his gold at Baden: twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, eighteen dollars a week, and more&mdash;a thousand dollars every
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorel wipes his brow. A thousand dollars in one year! It is like a
      temptation of the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorel ventures another inquiry. The <i>chef</i> of the customhouse,
      esteeming the old sol'iers so highly, is an old sol'ier himself,&mdash;is
      it not so? He has fought for his country? Doubtless he has lost an arm.
      And Sorel instinctively lets his right arm hang limp, as if the sleeve
      were empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; the <i>chef</i> was an editor and a statesman in the time of the war.
      He had greatly desired to go to fight, but his duties did not permit it.
      Still, he loves the old soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another advance in the conversation, this time by Mr. Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      The government, it seems, has now awakened, with deep distress, to the
      fact that one class of her soldiers she has hitherto forgotten. The
      government&mdash;that is, the <i>chef</i> of the customhouse&mdash;had
      this very morning said to Mr. Fox that this class of old soldiers must be
      brought forward, for trust and for honor. "We must choose, for this vacant
      place," the <i>chef</i> had said,&mdash;here Mr. Fox brings his face
      forward in close proximity to Sorel's astonished countenance,&mdash;"we
      must have, not only an old soldier, but&mdash;<i>a Frenchman!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a soldier lives here," says Mr. Fox; "is it not true? So brave, so
      honest, so modest, so faithful! Ready to die for his country; worthy of
      trust and worthy of reward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mais!</i>" with amazement. Yes, such a sol-'ier lives here. But can it
      be that monsieur refers to our Fidèle?
    </p>
    <p>
      Precisely so!
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Sorel, hard, hairless, but French, weeps, and embraces Mr. Fox
      as the representative of the great government at Washington; and, weeping
      and laughing, leads him downstairs and presents him to Fidèle and to the
      bear-leaders, and opens a bottle of weak vinegar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such an ovation as Fidèle receives! And such a generous government! To
      send a special messenger to seek out the old sergeant in his retirement!
      So thoughtful! But it is all of a piece with its unfailing care in the
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fidèle begins, on the spot, to resume something of his former erectness
      and soldierly bearing; to shake off the stoop and slouch which lameness
      and the drawing about of his "<i>musique</i>" have given him. He wishes to
      tell the story of Lookout Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Fox is about to go, he recollects himself. Oh, by the way, one
      thing more. It is not pleasant to mingle sadness with rejoicing. But Mr.
      Fox is the reluctant bearer of a gentle reproach from the great government
      at Washington. Her French children,&mdash;are they not just a little
      remiss? And when she is so bountiful, so thoughtful!
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mais</i>&mdash;how you mean?" (with surprise.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Why,&mdash;and there is a certain pathos in Mr. Fox's tone, as he stands
      facing Sorel, with the gaze of a loving, reproachful friend,&mdash;why,
      how many of the Frenchmen of this quarter are ever seen now at the
      pleasant gatherings of the Republicans, in the wardroom? The Republic, the
      Republicans,&mdash;it is all one. Is that quite kind to the Republic?
      Should not her French children, on their part, show filial devotion to the
      fond government?
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mais</i>," M. Sorel swiftly explains, "they are weary of going; they
      understand nothing. One sits and smokes a little while, and one talks;
      then one puts a little ticket into one's hand; one is jammed into a long
      file; one slips his ticket into a box; he knows not for whom he is voting;
      it is like a flock of sheep. What is the use of going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! that is the trouble? Then they are unjustly reproached. The government
      has indeed neglected to guide them. But suppose that some officer of the
      government&mdash;Mr. Fox himself, for instance&mdash;will be at the
      meeting? Then can M. Sorel induce those good French citizens to come?
    </p>
    <p>
      Induce them! They will be only too ready; in fact, at a word from M.
      Sorel, and particularly when the news of this great honor to Fidèle shall
      have spread abroad, twenty, thirty, forty will go to every meeting,&mdash;that
      is, if a friend be there to guide them. At the very next meeting, <i>monsieur</i>
      shall see whether the great government's French children are neglectful!
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the great government, in the person of Mr. Fox, then and there
      falls in spirit upon the neck of her French citizen-children, represented
      by Sorel and Fidèle, and full reconciliation is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Mr. Fox will come again. M. Sorel must introduce him to those brave
      Frenchmen, his friends and neighbors; Mr. Fox must grasp them by the hand,
      one by one. Sorel must take him to the <i>Société des Franco-Américains</i>,
      where they gather. The government wishes to know them better. And (this in
      a confidential whisper) there may be other places to be filled. What!
      Suppose, now, that the government should some day demand the services of
      M. Sorel himself in the custom-house; and, since he is a business man, at
      a still larger salary than a thousand dollars a year!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, <i>monsieur</i>" (in a tone of playful reproach), "<i>vous êtes un
      flatteur, n'est ce pas?</i> You know,&mdash;I guess you giv'n' me taffy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a hero as Fidèle is! No more balloons, no more carting about of "<i>ma
      musique</i>;" a square room upstairs, a bottle of wine at dinner, short
      hours, distinction,&mdash;in fine, all that the heart can wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been speaking in the present: I should have spoken in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was shortly after Fidèle's appointment&mdash;in the early autumn&mdash;that
      I first made his and Sorel's acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was teaching in an evening school, not far from Madeira Place, and among
      my scholars was Sorel's only son, a boy of perhaps fourteen, whom his
      father had left behind, for a time, at school in France, and had but
      lately brought over. He was a shy, modest, intelligent little fellow,
      utterly out of place in his rude surroundings. From the pleasant village
      home-school, of which he sometimes told me, to the <i>Maison Sorel</i>,
      was a grating change.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was always waiting for me at the schoolroom door, and was always the
      last one to speak to me at closing. Perhaps I reminded him of some young
      usher whom he had known when life was more pleasant.

      If, however, the <i>Maison Sorel</i> chafed Auguste, it was not for lack
      of affection on his father's part Sorel often came with him to the door of
      the school-room; and every night, rain or shine, he was there at nine to
      accompany him home. It was in this way that I first came to know Sorel;
      and whether it was from some kindness that Auguste may have thought I
      showed, or because I could talk a little French, Sorel took a great liking
      to me. At first, he and Auguste would walk with me a few blocks after
      school; then he would look in upon me for a few minutes at the law-office
      where I was studying, where I had a large anteroom to myself; finally,
      nothing would do but that I should visit him at his house. I had always
      been fond of strolling about the wharves, and I should have liked very
      well to stop occasionally at Sorel's, if I could have been allowed to sit
      in the kitchen and hear the general conversation. But this was not
      sufficient state for "M. le maître d'école." I must be drawn off upstairs
      to the bedroom parlor, to hear of Auguste's virtues. Such devotion I have
      seldom seen. Sorel would have praised Auguste, with tears in his eyes, for
      hours together, if I would have stayed to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had many things to show in that parlor. He had gyroscopes: and he would
      wind them up and set half-a-dozen of those anti-natural tops spinning
      straight out in the air for my diversion. There were great sacks of
      uninflated balloons, and delicate sheet-rubber, from which Sorel made up
      balloons. There were other curious things in rubber,&mdash;a
      tobacco-pouch, for example, in perfect outward imitation of an iron
      kilogramme-weight, with a ring to lift it by, warranted to create "immense
      surprise" among those who should lift it for iron; tobacco-pouches, too,
      in fac-simile of lobsters and crabs and reptiles, colored to nature, which
      Sorel assured me would cause roars of laughter among my friends: there was
      no pleasanter way, he said, of entertaining an evening company than
      suddenly to display one of these creatures, and make the ladies scream and
      run about. He presented me, at different times, with a gyroscope, a
      kilogramme-weight and a lobster with a blue silk lining.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time ran on, and, in the early winter, I began practice, Sorel brought
      me a little business. He had to sue two Graeco-Roman wrestlers for board
      and attach their box-office receipts. Some Frenchman had heard of a little
      legacy left him in the Calvados, and wanted me to look up the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fidèle, too, came to me every quarter-day, to make oath before me to his
      pension certificate, and stopped and made a short call. He had little to
      say about France. His great romance had been the war, although it seemed
      to have fused itself into a hazy, high-colored dream of danger,
      excitement, suffering, and generous devotion. Tears always rose in his
      eyes when he spoke of "<i>la république?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      In those first days of practice, anything by the name of law business wore
      a halo, and I used to encourage Sorel's calls, partly for this reason and
      partly for practice in talking French with a common man. I hoped to go to
      France some day, and I wanted to be able then to talk not only with the
      grammatical, but with the dear people who say, "I guess likely," and "How
      be you?" in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Sorel was rather amusing. He was something of a humorist. Once
      he came to tell me, excitedly, that Auguste was learning music: "<i>Il
      touche au violon,&mdash;mais</i>&mdash;'e play so <i>bien!</i>" And
      Sorel's eyes opened in wonder at the boy's quickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who teaches him?" I asked. "Some Frenchman who plays in the theatre?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mais</i>, no," Sorel replied, with a broad drollery in his eye; "<i>un
      professeur d'occasion!</i>" It was a ruined music-teacher, engaged now in
      selling balloons from Madeira Place, who was the "<i>professeur d'occasion</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Sorel appeared with a great story to tell. Auguste, it seemed, had
      wearied of home, and was determined to go to sea. Nothing could deter him.
      Whereupon M. Sorel had hit upon a stratagem. He had hunted up, somewhere
      along the wharves, two French sailors with conversational powers, and had
      retained them to stay at his house for two or three days, as chance
      comers. It was inevitable that Auguste should ply them with eager
      questions,&mdash;and they knew their part.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sorel, entering into the situation now with all his dramatic nature,
      with his eyes wide open, repeated to me some of the tales of horror which
      they had palmed off upon innocent Auguste as spontaneous truth, I could
      see, myself, the rigging covered with ice an inch thick; sailors climbing
      up ("Ah! <i>comme ils grimpent,&mdash;ils grimpent!</i>") bare-handed,
      their hands freezing to the ropes at every touch, and leaving flesh
      behind, "<i>comme</i> if you put your tongue to a lam'post in the winter."
      I could see the seamen's backs cut up with lashes for the slightest
      offences; I tasted the foul, unwholesome food. I think that Sorel half
      believed it all himself,&mdash;his imagination was so powerful,&mdash;forgetting
      that he had paid in silver coin for every word of it. At any rate, the
      ruse had been successful. Auguste had been thoroughly scared and had
      consented to stay at home, and the most threatening cloud of Sorel's life
      had blown over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, however, Sorel and I talked politics; and to our common pleasure
      we generally agreed. Sorel knew very little about the details of our
      government, and he would listen to me with the utmost eagerness while I
      practised my French upon him, explaining to his wondering mind the
      relations of the States to each other and to the general government, and
      the system of State and Federal courts. He was very quick, and he took in
      the ingenious scheme with great facility. Then he would tell me about the
      workings of government in the French villages and departments; and as he
      read French papers, he had always something in the way of news or
      explanation of recent events. I have since come to believe that he was
      exceedingly well informed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most singular thing about him to me was how he could cherish on the
      one hand such devotion as he plainly did, to France, and on the other hand
      such a passionate attachment to the United States. In truth, that double
      patriotism is one of the characteristic features of our country.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could lead him, in twenty minutes, through the whole gamut of emotion,
      by talking about Auguste, and then of politics. It was irresistible, the
      temptation to lead him out. A word about Auguste, and he would wipe tears
      from his eyes. A mention of Gambetta, and the bare idea filled him with
      enthusiasm; he was instantly, in imagination, one of a surging crowd,
      throwing his hat in the air, or drawing Gambetta's carriage through the
      streets of Paris. I had only to speak of Alsace to bring him to a mood of
      sullen ugliness and hatred. He was, I have no doubt, a pretty
      good-tempered man; he was certainly warm-hearted; his apparent harshness
      to his balloon-venders was probably nothing more than necessary parental
      severity, and he was always ready to recognize their successes. But I have
      never seen a more wicked and desperate expression than an allusion to
      Alsace called up in his face and in his whole bearing. Sometimes he would
      laugh, when I mentioned the severed province; but it was with a hard,
      metallic, cruel laugh.' He felt the loss as he would have felt the loss of
      a limb. The first time I brought up the topic, I saw the whole bitter
      story of the dismembering of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another subject which called out that same bitter revengeful
      look, and that cruel nasal laugh,&mdash;the royalist factions and the
      Bonapartists. When we spoke of them, and I watched his face and heard his
      soulless laughter, I saw the French Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could always be brought back to open childish delight and warmth by
      a reference to the United States. Our government, in his eyes, embodied
      all that was good. France was now a "<i>république</i>," to be sure, and
      he rejoiced in the fact; but he plainly felt the power and settled
      stability of our republic, and he seemed to have a filial devotion toward
      it closely akin to his love for Auguste.
    </p>
    <p>
      How fortunate we were! Here were no <i>Légitimistes</i>, no <i>Orléanistes</i>,
      no <i>Bonapartistes</i>, for a perpetual menace! Here all citizens,
      however else their views might differ, believed, at least, in the
      republic, and desired to stay her hands. There were no factions here
      continually plotting in the darkness. Here the machinery of government was
      all in view, and open to discussion and improvement Ah, what a proud,
      happy country is this!"<i>Que c'est une république!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      I gathered enthusiasm myself from this stranger's ardor for the country of
      his adoption. I think that I appreciated better, through him, the free
      openness of our institutions. It is of great advantage to meet an intense
      man, of associations different from your own, who, by his very intensity
      and narrowness, instantly puts you at his standpoint. I viewed the United
      States from the shores of a sister republic which has to contend against
      strong and organized political forces not fully recognized in the laws,
      working beneath the surface, which nevertheless are facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      One acquaintance leads to another. Through Sorel, whose house was the
      final resort of Frenchmen in distress, and their asylum if they were
      helpless, not only Fidèle, but a number of other Frenchmen of that
      neighborhood, began to come to me with their small affairs. I was the <i>avocat</i>
      who "speak French." I am afraid that they were surprised at my "French"
      when they heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a willow-worker from the Pas-de-Calais, a deformed man, walking
      high and low, and always wanting to rise from his chair and lay his hand
      upon my shoulder, as he talked, who came to consult me about the recovery
      of a hundred francs which he had advanced at <i>Anvers</i> to a Belgian
      tailor upon the pledge of a sewing-machine, on consideration that the
      tailor, who was to come in a different steamer, should take charge of the
      willow-worker's dog on the voyage: the willow-worker had a wife and six
      children to look after. This was a lofty contest; but I had time then. I
      found a little amusement in the case, and I had the advantage of two or
      three hours in all of practical French conversation with men thoroughly in
      earnest. Finally, I had the satisfaction of settling their dispute, and so
      keeping them from a quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a French cook, out of a job, who wanted me to find him a
      place. He was gathering mushrooms, meanwhile, for the hotels. One day he
      surprised me by coming into my office in a white linen cap, brandishing in
      his hand a long, gleaming knife. He only desired, however, to tell me that
      he had found a place at one of the clubs, and to show, in his pride, the
      shining blade which he had just bought as his equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man who impressed me most, after Sorel, was Carron. He first
      appeared as the friend of the cook,&mdash;whom he introduced to me, with
      many flourishes and compliments, although he was an utter stranger
      himself. Carron was a well-built and rather handsome man, of medium
      height, and was then perhaps fifty years of age. He had a remarkably
      bright, intelligent face, curling brown hair, and a full, wavy brown
      beard. He kept a rival boarding-house, not far from Sorel's, in a gabled
      wooden house two hundred years old, which was anciently the home of an
      eminent Puritan divine. In the oak-panelled room where the theologian
      wrote his famous tract upon the Carpenter who Profanely undertook to
      Dispense the Word in the way of Public Ministration, and was Divinely
      struck Dumb in consequence, Carron now sold beer from a keg.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain at a glance that his present was not of a piece with his past
      I could not place him. His manners were easy and agreeable, and yet he was
      not a gentleman. He was well informed, and evidently of some mental
      training, and yet he was not quite an educated man. After his first visit
      to me, with the cook, he, too, occasionally looked in upon me, generally
      late in the afternoon, when I could call the day's work done and could
      talk French for half an hour with him, in place of taking a walk. He was
      strongly dramatic, like Sorel, but in a different way. Sorel was intense;
      Carron was <i>théâtral</i>. He was very fond of declamation; and seeing
      from the first my wish to learn French,&mdash;which Sorel would never very
      definitely recognize,&mdash;he often recited to me, for ear practice, and
      in an exceedingly effective way, passages from the Old Testament. He
      seemed to know the Psalms by heart. He was a good deal of an actor, and he
      took the part of a Hebrew prophet with great effect. But his fervor was
      all stage fire, and he would turn in an instant from a denunciatory Psalm
      to a humorous story. Even his stories were of a religious cast, like those
      which ministers relate when they gather socially. He told me once about a
      priest who was strolling along the bank of the Loire, when a drunken
      sailor accosted him and reviled him as a lazy good-for-nothing, a <i>fainéant</i>,
      and slapped his face. The priest only turned the other cheek to him.
      "Strike again," he said; and the sailor struck. "Now, my friend," said the
      priest, "the Scripture tells us that when one strikes us we are to turn
      the other cheek. There it ends its instruction and leaves us to follow our
      own judgment." Whereupon, being a powerful man, he collared the sailor and
      plunged him into the water. He told me, too, with great unction, and with
      a roguish gleam in his eye, a story of a small child who was directed to
      prepare herself for confession, and, being given a manual for
      self-examination, found the wrong places, and appeared with this array of
      sins: "I have been unfaithful to my marriage vows.... I have not made the
      tour of my diocese."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carron had an Irish wife (<i>une Irlandaise</i>), much younger than he,
      whom he worshipped. He told me, one day, about his courtship. When he
      first met her, she knew not a word of French, and he not a word of
      English. He was greatly captivated (épris), and he had to contrive some
      mode of communication. They were both Catholics. He had a prayer-book with
      Latin and French in parallel columns; she had a similar prayer-book but in
      Latin and English. They would seat themselves; Carron would find in his
      prayer-book a sentence in French which would suit his turn, on a pinch,
      and through the medium of the Latin would find the corresponding passage
      in English in Norah's prayer-book and point it out to her. Norah, in her
      turn, would select and point out some passage in English which would serve
      as a tribute to Carron's charms, and he would discover in his prayer-book,
      in French, what that tribute was. Why should we deem the dead languages no
      longer a practical study, when Latin can gain for a Frenchman an Irish
      wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      Carron, as I have said, puzzled me. He had not the pensive air of one who
      has seen better days. He was more than cheerful in his present life: he
      was full of spirits; and yet it was plain that he had been brought up for
      something different. I asked him once to tell me, for French lessons, the
      story of his life. With the most charming complaisance, he at once
      consented; but he proceeded in such endless detail, the first time, in an
      account of his early boyhood in a strict Benedictine monastery school, in
      the south of France, as to suggest that he was talking against time. And
      although his spirited and amusing picture of his childhood days only
      awakened my curiosity, I could never persuade him to resume the history.
      It was always "the next time."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be poor: but he never asked a favor except for others. On the
      contrary, he brought me some little business. A <i>Belge</i> had been
      cheated out of five hundred dollars; I recovered half of it for him. A
      Frenchman from <i>le Midi</i> had bought out a little business, and the
      seller had immediately set up shop next door; I succeeded in shutting up
      the rival. I was a prodigy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time I was told something further as to Carron's life. He had been
      a Capuchin monk, in a monastery at or near Paris. The instant that I heard
      this statement, I felt in my very soul that it was true. My eye had always
      missed something in Carron. I now knew exactly what it was,&mdash;a shaved
      crown, bare feet, and a cowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the usage for the brethren of his order to go about Paris barefoot,
      begging. They were not permitted by the <i>concierges</i> to go into the
      great apartment hotels. But "Carron, <i>il est très fin</i>," said my
      informant; "you know,&mdash;'e is var' smart." Carron would learn, by
      careful inquiry, the name of a resident on an upper floor; then he would
      appear at the <i>concierge's</i> door, and would mention the name of this
      resident with such adroit, demure, and absolute confidence that he would
      be permitted at once to ascend. Once inside, he would go the rounds of the
      apartments. So he would get five times as much in a day as any of his
      fellows. A certain amount of the receipts he would yield up to the
      treasury of the monastery; the rest he kept for himself. After a while
      this came to be suspected, and he quietly withdrew to a new country.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not the slightest tangible corroboration of this story. It might
      have been the merest gossip or the invention of an enemy. But it fitted
      Carron so perfectly, that from the day I heard it I could never, somehow,
      question its substantial truth. If I had questioned it, I should have
      repeated the story to him, to give him an opportunity to answer. But
      something warned me not to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fidèle held on well at the custom-house, and I think that he became a
      general favorite. No one who took the old soldier by the hand and looked
      him in the eye could question his absolute honesty; and as for skill in
      his duties,&mdash;well, it was the custom-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not saving much money. He was free to give and free to lend to
      his fellow-countrymen; and, moreover, various ways were pointed out to him
      by Mr. Fox, from time to time, in which an old soldier, delighting to aid
      his country, could serve her pecuniarily. The republic,&mdash;that is, the
      Republicans,&mdash;it was all one.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, late in summer, Fidèle appeared at my office. He seldom
      visited me, except quarterly for his pension affidavit. As he came in now,
      I saw that something had happened. His grisly face wore the same kindly
      smile that it had always borne, but the light had gone out of it. His
      story was short. He had lost his place. He had been notified that his
      services would not be needed after Saturday. No reason had been given him;
      he was simply dismissed in humiliation. There must be some
      misunderstanding, such as occurs between the warmest friends. And was not
      the great government his friend? Did it not send him his pension
      regularly? Had it not sent a special messenger to seek him out, in his
      obscurity, for this position; and was he not far better suited to it now
      than at the outset?
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to questions from me, he told me more about Mr. Fox's first visit
      than I had hitherto known. I asked him, in a casual way, about the
      ward-meetings, and whether the French citizens generally attended them.
      No, they had been dropping off; they had become envious, perhaps, of him;
      they had formed a club, with Carron for president, and had voted to act in
      a body (<i>en solidarité</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I told Fidèle that I knew no way to help him, and that I feared his
      dismission was final. He could not understand me, but went away, leaning
      on his cane, dragging his left foot sidewise behind him, with something of
      the air of an old faithful officer who has been deprived of his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been gone more than an hour, when the door opened again, and
      Carron looked in. Seeing that I was alone, he closed the door and walked
      very slowly toward my desk,&mdash;erect, demure, impassive, looking
      straight forward and not at me, with an air as if he were bearing a candle
      in high mass, intoning, as he came, a passage from the Psalms: "<i>Je me
      ré-jouirai; je partagerai Sichem, et je mesurerai la vallée de Succoth.
      Galaad sera à moi, Manassé sera à moi.... Moab sera le bassin où je me
      laverai et je jetterai mon soulier sur Édom.... Qui est-ce qui me conduira
      dans la ville forte? Qui est-ce qui me conduira jusquen Édom?</i>" (I will
      rejoice; I will divide Shechem and mete out the valley of Succoth. Gilead
      is mine; Ma-nasseh is mine.... Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast
      out my shoe.... Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me
      into Edom?)
    </p>
    <p>
      Carron propounded the closing inquiry with great unction; his manner
      expressed entire confidence that some one would be found to lead him into
      the strong city, to lead him into Edom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had lost something of my interest in Carron since I had heard the story
      of his Parisian exploits; but I could not help being amused at his manner.
      It portended something. He made no disclosure, however. Whatever he had to
      tell, he went away without telling it, contenting himself for the present
      with intimating by his triumphal manner that great good fortune was in the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday afternoon, as I was about closing my desk,&mdash;a little
      earlier than usual, for it was a most tempting late September day, and the
      waves of the harbor, which I could just see from my office window, called
      loudly to me,&mdash;Sorel appeared. I held out my hand, but he affected
      not to see it, and he sat down without a word. He was plainly disturbed
      and somewhat excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I knew that it was his old friend's misfortune which weighed
      upon him; he was proud and fond of Fidèle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seated myself, and waited for him to speak. In a moment he began, with a
      low, hard laugh: "<i>Semble que notre bon Fidèle a sa démission</i>: you
      know,&mdash;our Fidèle got bounced!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I said, Fidèle had told me so, and I was very sorry to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Evidemment</i>" (this in a tone of irony) "<i>il faut un homme plus
      juste, plus loyale, que le pauvre Fidèle!</i> (You know,&mdash;they got to
      'ave one more honester man!) <i>Bien!</i> You know who goin' 'ave 'is
      place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorel laid down his hat, and wiped his brow with his handkerchief. Then he
      went on, no longer speaking in French and then translating,&mdash;his
      usual concession to my supposed desires,&mdash;but mostly now in
      quasi-English: "<i>Mais</i>, you thing this great <i>gouvernement</i> wan'
      hones' men work for her, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The government ought to have the most honest men," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Bien</i>. Now you thing the <i>gouvernement</i> boun' to 'ave some men
      w'at mos' know the business, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ought to have them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorel wiped his brow again. "Now, w'ich you thing the mos' honestes' man,&mdash;Fidèle,
      or&mdash; <i>Carron?</i> W'ich you thing know the business bes',&mdash;Fidèle,
      w'at been there, or Carron, w'at ain' been there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fidèle, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then tell me, w'at for they bounce' our Fidèle, and let Carron got 'is
      place?" and he burst into a harsh, resonant, contemptuous laugh. In a
      moment he resumed: "Now," he said, "I only got one more thing to ax you,"
      and taking his felt hat in his hands, he held it on his knees, before him,
      and stooping a little forward, eyed me closely: "You know w'at we talk
      sometimes, you an' me, 'bout our Frensh <i>république</i>&mdash;some <i>Orléanistes</i>,
      some <i>Légitimistes</i>, some <i>Bonapartistes?</i> You merember 'ow we
      talk, you and me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded,
    </p>
    <p>
      "We ain' got no <i>Orléanistes</i>, no <i>Bonapartistes' ici</i>, in this
      <i>gouvernement, n'est-ce pas?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      I intimated that I had never met any.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," he proceeded, with an increased bitterness in his tone and his hard
      smile, "I use' thing you one good frien' to me, <i>mais</i>, you been
      makin' fool of me all that time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't think any such thing," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know," he went on, "who bounce our Fidèle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorel received my reply with a low, incredulous laugh. Then he laid his
      hat down on the floor, drew his chair closer, held out his finger, and,
      with the air of one who shows another that he knows his secret he
      demanded:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un 'Boss'?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat silent for a moment, looking at him, not knowing just what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mais</i>," he went on, "all the <i>Américains</i>" (they were chiefly
      Irish) "roun' my 'ouse been tellin' me, long time, '<i>Le</i> Boss goin'
      bounce Fidèle.' Me, I laugh w'en they say so. I say, '<i>Le Boss? C'est un
      créature d'imagination, pour nous effrayer,' you know, make us scart '</i>C'est
      un loup-garou,' you know,&mdash;w'at make 'fraid li'l chil'ren. That's
      w'at I tell them. I thing then you would n't been makin' fool of me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't know what they are talking about," I said. "How can they know
      why Fidèle is removed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mais</i>, you jus' wait; I goin' tell you. I fin they do know. Fidèle
      take he sol'ier-papers, an' he go see <i>le chef</i>" (here Sorel rose,
      and acted Fidèle). "Fidèle, 'e show 'is papers to <i>le chef</i>; 'e say,
      'Now you boun' tell me why <i>le bon gouvernement</i>, w'at 's been my
      frien', bounce me now.' 'E say <i>le chef</i> boun' to tell 'im,&mdash;<i>il
      faut absolument!</i> 'E say 'e won' go, way if <i>le chef</i> don' tell
      'im; an' you know, no man can't scare our Fidèle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," I said; "what did the collector, the <i>chef</i> tell him?
      Fidèle is too lame, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mais, non</i>," with a suspicious smile. "<i>Le chef</i>, he mos' cry,&mdash;yas,
      sar,&mdash;an' 'e say 'e ain' got no trouble 'gainst Fidèle; <i>la
      république</i>, she ain' got no trouble 'gainst Fidèle. 'E say 'e di'n
      want Fidèle to go; <i>le gouvernement</i>, she d'n want 'im to go. <i>Mais</i>,
      'e say, 'e can't help hisself; <i>le gouvernement</i>, she can't help
      herself. Yas, sar. Then Fidèle know w'at evarybody been tellin' us was
      true,&mdash;'e 'Boss,' 'e make 'im go!" And Sorel sat back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, I ax you one time more," he resumed: "<i>qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un
      'Boss'?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      What could I say! How could I explain, offhand, to this stranger, the big
      boss, the little boss, the State boss, the ward boss, the county boss, all
      burrowing underneath our theoretical government! How could I explain to
      him that Fidèle's department in the custom-house had been allotted to a
      Congressman about to run for a second term, who needed it to control a few
      more ward-meetings,&mdash;needed, in the third ward caucus, those very
      French votes which Carron had been shrewd enough to steal away and
      organize! What could I say to Sorel which he, innocent as he was, would
      not misconstrue as inconsistent with our past glorifications of our
      republic! What did I say! I do not know. I only remember that he
      interrupted me, harshly and abruptly, as he rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You an' me got great <i>pitié</i>, ain' we," he said, "for <i>notre
      France, la pauvre France</i>, 'cause she got so many folks w'at <i>tourbillonnent
      sous la surface,&mdash;les Orléanistes les Bonapartistes</i>; don' we say
      so? <i>Mais, il n'y en a pas, ici</i>,&mdash;you know, we ain' got none
      here; don' we say so? We ain' got no <i>factionnaires</i> here! <i>Mais
      non!</i>" Then, lowering his voice to a hoarse whisper: "<i>Votre bonne
      république,</i>" he said,&mdash;"<i>c'est une république du théâtre!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly closed the door behind him, when he opened it again, and put
      in his head, and with his hard, mocking laugh, demanded, "<i>Qu'est-ce que
      c'est qu'un 'Boss'?</i>" And as he walked down the hall, I could still
      hear his scornful laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never came to see me again. I sometimes heard of him through Carron,
      who had succeeded to Fidèle's position and had elevated a considerable
      part of his following: for several weeks they were employed at three
      dollars a day in the navy-yard, where, to their utter mystification, they
      moved, with a certain planetary regularity, ship-timber from the west to
      the east side of the yard, and then back from the east side to the west.
      You remember reading about this in the published accounts of our late
      congressional contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Sorel never visited me again, I occasionally saw him: once near the
      evening-school, when I went as a guest; once in the long market; once in
      the post-office; and once he touched me on the shoulder, as I was leaning
      over the street railing, by the dock, looking down at a Swedish bark. Each
      time he had but one thing to say; and having said it, he would break into
      his harsh, ironical laugh, and pass along:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un 'Boss'?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Fidèle?
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, if you will go to Madeira Place at sunset, you may see the cap and
      blouse come slowly in. Still the old sergeant sits at the head of the
      table. But his ideal is gone; his idol has clay feet. No longer does he
      describe to new-comers from France the receipt of his pension. All the old
      fond pride in it is gone, and he takes the money now as dollars and cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the conversation, however, around the table the great government at
      Washington is by no means forgotten. Sometimes Sorel tells his guests
      about the Boss.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
